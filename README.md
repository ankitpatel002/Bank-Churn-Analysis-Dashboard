🔍 Bank Churn Analysis Dashboard 🔍

I’ve just finished building a Bank Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, with data sourced from Kaggle! This dashboard focuses on understanding customer behavior and identifying potential churn risks.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what’s included:

Key Metrics:

Total Customers
Current Balance
Average Age
Average Credit Card Score
Average Tenure (Years)
Breakdown by Gender (Female/Male)
Interactive Filters:

Exited Customers
Active Customers
Credit Card Status
Visual Insights:

Stacked Bar Charts: Customers by Number of Products, Distribution by Salary Category, Age Group, and Tenure Range
Donut Chart: Regional Distribution of Customers
A detailed table showcasing the Top 5 Customers by Current Balance
I’m proud of how this dashboard turned out, and it’s a powerful tool for spotting trends that could help reduce customer churn.
